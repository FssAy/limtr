# Limtr

Limtr is a crate designed for implementing rate limiting in various applications and scenarios.


## Current State

The crate is currently functional for applications based onto tokio's runtime, but may have a notable memory footprint.

As Limtr is still in its Proof of Concept (PoC) phase, I recommend refraining from using it in production environments until the release of version 1.0.
