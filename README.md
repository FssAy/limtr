# Limtr

Limtr is a versatile crate designed for implementing rate limiting in various applications and scenarios.


## Current State

The crate is currently functional but may have a notable memory footprint.

The implementation of the index map is basic and has significant room for optimization.

As Limtr is still in its Proof of Concept (PoC) phase, I recommend refraining from using it in production environments until the release of version 1.0.
